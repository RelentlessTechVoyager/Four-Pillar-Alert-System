# Four-Pillar-Alert-System
This is a project which I(along with my team) have worked on during Induction Phase in my club journey of "The Robotics Club"
## Problem
There are many accidents occurring at sharp turns especially at narrow roads for example at ghat roads or hilly areas, Traffic Police intervention, convex mirrors installation, and other techniques, though are helpful to some extent in these situations but eventually are inefficient in preventing accidents. <br>
### Existing System-
A convex mirror is placed at the sharp turning on hilly areas, but the disadvantage of this convex mirror is that until the vehicle comes closer to the mirror they can't see other side. The drivers are not alert of the opposite vehicles. It become difficult to manage vehicles in severe and extreme conditions like rainfall, snow, foggy weather and high number of sharp curves and U-turns. <br>
Also in hilly areas, due to narrow roads it is difficult for two vehicles to pass in opposite directions so in order to reduce this problem as well, we need to develop a system that can manage the flow of vehicles smoothly at narrows roads.
## Problem Statement
Blind turns, characterized by limited visibility, pose significant risks to drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. Accidents at blind turns often occur due to the inability to anticipate oncoming vehicles or pedestrians, leading to collisions and potential fatalities. The Smart Road System seeks to tackle this problem by employing advanced technologies and intelligent infrastructure.

## Team's Approach
A four pillar vehicle alert system, is helpful to reduce the accidents at <b>Blind curves</b> and <b>hair pin bend roads</b>. When a vehicle is detected on one side of the road Alert signal will be provided to the other side of the road to prevent road accidents and traffic congestion at blind curve. Furthermore, the vehicle on the other side of the hill/road will be stopped to increase the efficiency of our system.
